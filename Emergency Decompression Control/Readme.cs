/*
 Emergency Decompression Control
 ===============================

 This script will manage doors on your station to minimize the impace of
 decompression events.

 Quick Start
 -----------
 
 Your ship or station must be divided into "zones". Each zone must have at least one vent and each
 zone must have doors between it and every connected zone (ie so you can isolate a zone with a
 leak). Each zone must have a unique name made up of only letters, numbers or spaces.

 Adjust the name of each vent to contain "[#" + the zone name + "]" (Eg "[#Bridge]"). You can leave
 any other parts of the name intact (Eg "Air Vent 1 [#Bridge]").

 The each door needs to be similarly labeled with the name of each zone it
